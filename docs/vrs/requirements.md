# pty requirements

## Context

The [README](../../README.md) is the concise purpose and user guide for `pty`.
These requirements define its durable, testable system constraints. The
implementation contract and validation map live in [spec.md](./spec.md).

## Assumptions

- **A01 Unix host:** Supported hosts provide Unix PTYs, Unix-domain sockets,
  process signals, and atomic same-filesystem rename. The supported products are
  macOS and Linux.
- **A02 Trusted user boundary:** One registry belongs to one trusted OS user.
  Filesystem permissions are the access boundary; readonly mode is behavior,
  not authorization.
- **A03 Terminal semantics:** Child output is an ordered terminal byte stream.
  Reconstructing it requires a terminal emulator rather than line-oriented logs.
- **A04 Output observation:** The per-session daemon necessarily observes every
  PTY output chunk to maintain terminal state. Recording when output last
  occurred adds no second observer and carries no launcher or harness semantics.

## Acceptable tradeoffs

- **T01 Per-session daemon:** Each session pays for an independent daemon in
  exchange for client-independent lifetime and failure isolation.
- **T02 Shared grid:** All writable-attached clients share the minimum requested
  rows and minimum requested columns so every attached writer can represent the
  complete grid.
- **T03 Pre-1.0 compatibility:** Public storage and package APIs may evolve
  before 1.0, but readers remain bounded and documented compatibility tiers are
  preserved deliberately.

## Requirements

### Must preserve runtime meaning

- **R01 Independent session lifetime:** A session child and terminal state
  continue independently of creating, attached, detached, or observing clients;
  failure of one session or client does not implicitly terminate another.
- **R02 Durable launch context:** Initial launch, explicit restart, and
  policy-driven respawn preserve command, arguments, working directory, initial
  geometry, lifetime policy, labels, tags, and child-environment policy.
  Exact-environment mode is exclusive with inherited/isolate policy; inherited
  removals precede assignments. Ordinary assigned values, including an empty
  `NO_COLOR`, remain exact. `PTY_SESSION` and its generation token are
  runtime-owned; absent or empty `TERM` selects `xterm-256color`, while a
  nonempty terminal name is preserved. Historical metadata without removals
  retains ambient-inheritance behavior.
- **R03 Ordered, generation-safe lifecycle:** Child output is drained before
  exit is finalized. Restart, permanent reconciliation, abandonment, explicit
  removal, and cleanup follow explicit policy and cannot mutate or delete a
  replacement generation. Recovery after external registry unlink rebinds the
  same supporting daemon and child without signaling, restarting, relaunching,
  duplicating the provider, or disconnecting existing clients.

### Must reconstruct one shared terminal

- **R04 Ordered reconstruction:** Every valid attach or recognized peek that
  emits terminal state sends effective geometry, exactly one screen baseline,
  then post-cut data and at most one process exit in source order. A later mode
  request supersedes an unfinished generation; reconnect starts a new one.
- **R05 Replaceable client roles:** A fresh command socket accepts input and
  status requests but starts no screen baseline, has no geometry membership,
  and cannot resize. A complete `ATTACH` makes it writable-attached, retaining
  input and status capabilities while installing requested geometry, enabling
  resize, and starting ordered baseline synchronization. A recognized `PEEK`
  makes it readonly and removes its geometry constraint. A malformed attach
  changes neither role nor synchronization generation.
- **R06 Deterministic geometry:** Effective rows and columns are the independent
  minima requested by writable-attached clients. Attach, resize, and disconnect
  recompute them; readonly observation never constrains them. Geometry changes
  are visible before terminal bytes produced for the new size.
- **R07 Bounded stream protocol:** Packets are length-delimited, fragmented
  input is reassembled, oversized input is rejected without unbounded
  buffering, and reconnect or unsupported capability failure is explicit.
- **R08 Machine attach outcomes:** Machine attach preserves the framed
  `GEOMETRY`, `SCREEN`, `DATA`, and `EXIT` stream on a caller-owned inherited
  descriptor while stdin/stdout remain the controlling terminal. A clean stream
  ends with exactly one `EXIT` when the session process ended or empty `DETACH`
  when this client intentionally detached; EOF without either is truncation.
  Administrative destruction is truncation unless process `EXIT` was observed.

### Must expose durable state through one behavioral core

- **R09 Stable, inspectable registry:** Registry root and filename-safe stable
  id are explicit. Display names and tags are presentation metadata. Inventory
  and status expose lifecycle, clients, requested/effective geometry, resources,
  metadata, and any live-recovery capability without attaching or mutating the
  session.
- **R10 Durable, compatible records:** Metadata retains the launch and lifecycle
  fields needed for inspection and restart, preserves unknown fields on update,
  and uses generation-aware atomic replacement. Events are external-readable
  JSONL records with bounded retention. Readers reject structurally invalid or
  unbounded input while retaining documented legacy fallbacks. Live recovery
  authenticates the current private registry root, recovery directory,
  generation, daemon process, launch identity, and metadata revision; it fails
  closed on stale, replayed, interrupted-publication, tampered, wrong-root, or
  path-replacement attempts while allowing an authenticated interrupted lock to
  resume.
- **R11 Equivalent supported surfaces:** CLI commands, exported client/server/
  protocol/testing APIs, the shipped package entrypoint, local transport, and
  remote routing preserve the applicable runtime, stream, geometry, registry,
  and lifecycle contracts. A surface rejects unsupported capabilities instead
  of silently weakening them; tests use real PTYs and processes.
- **R12 Exact-generation retained exit evidence:** Supported client and CLI
  surfaces expose one bounded, tagged snapshot of retained terminal evidence
  for an exact stable id and opaque generation, distinguishing exited,
  vanished, live, missing, busy, unavailable, and invalid state. Conditional
  cleanup removes artifacts only while that same terminal generation remains;
  it never removes a live or replacement generation. Semantic outcomes and
  operational failures are machine-distinguishable, and validation covers the
  snapshot-to-cleanup race with real processes.
- **R13 Discoverable key notation:** Supported key-input surfaces resolve named
  keys case-insensitively and accept unambiguous modifier chords using `+`,
  `-`, or `_` separators, including compact `C-` control notation. Invalid,
  incomplete, or ambiguous key specs fail before any sequence bytes are sent;
  their diagnostics state the accepted modifiers, notation, and key names.
- **R14 Durable output-activity evidence:** Session metadata exposes an optional
  unix-millisecond `lastOutputAtMs` timestamp. The daemon stamps it in the
  existing output path and persists the newest value through the same locked,
  generation-aware metadata mutation, debounced to at most one write per second
  per busy session. Exit finalization carries the final in-memory stamp. The
  field reports evidence only: PTY does not classify active/idle, infer liveness,
  or authorize lifecycle/delivery behavior. Older records without the field
  remain valid.
