# pty on-disk layout

> **Pre-1.0.** Format may change in any release; pin to a pty version if you depend on these files. Breaking changes appear under `### Storage format` in the CHANGELOG.

For non-Node tools that want to read pty's state without paying Node startup. The CLI is the canonical writer; the files below are the canonical readable surface.

## Directory

`$PTY_ROOT` (default `~/.local/state/pty`, mode `0700`, single-user). Every CLI command honors the env var. The pre-Phase-2 name `$PTY_SESSION_DIR` still works with a one-time deprecation notice; set `PTY_ROOT_LEGACY_SILENT=1` to suppress it.

| file | purpose | tier |
|---|---|---|
| `<name>.json` | session metadata | 1 |
| `<name>.events.jsonl` | append-only event log | 1 |
| `<name>.sock` | daemon IPC socket (Unix) | 2 |
| `<name>.pid` | daemon pid (decimal) | 2 |
| `<name>.lock` | creation-race lock | 2 |
| `.recovery/` | authenticated request/result exchange for supported live daemons | 2 |
| `<name>.events.lock` | event append/retention lock | 2 |
| `theme` | last-selected TUI theme | 2 |
| `gc.log` | stdout/stderr of `pty gc` when run by launchd/cron (only present after auto-running gc is installed) | 2 |
| `<name>.json.tmp.<pid>.<rand>` | atomic-write tmp — readers MUST ignore | n/a |
| `<name>.events.jsonl.tmp.<pid>.<rand>` | same | n/a |

**Tier 1**: we'll try not to break these; changes called out in CHANGELOG.
**Tier 2**: pty-internal; may move freely.

## Atomic write contract

pty writes to `<target>.tmp.<pid>.<rand>` then `rename()`s into place. POSIX same-filesystem rename is atomic — readers see the old version or the new one, never partial. When scanning the directory, filter `*.tmp.*`.

## `<name>.json` (tier 1)

Pretty-printed JSON. Source of truth: `SessionMetadata` in `src/sessions.ts`.

```ts
{
  generation?: string;       // opaque daemon generation; guards cleanup ownership
  daemonPid?: number;        // daemon owning this generation, retained after child exit
  recovery?: {               // signal-free live-registry recovery capability
    protocol: 1;
    secret: string;          // opaque request-authentication key
    processStartToken: string;
    launchIdentity: string;
    rootDevice: number;
    rootInode: number;
    recoveryDirDevice: number;
    recoveryDirInode: number;
    metadataRevision: string; // exact revision bound to retained recovery state
  };
  command: string;            // resolved binary path
  args: string[];
  displayCommand: string;     // command as the user typed it
  cwd: string;
  rows?: number;              // initial terminal rows, persisted for restart
  cols?: number;              // initial terminal columns
  ephemeral?: boolean;
  isolateEnv?: boolean;
  extraEnv?: { [k: string]: string }; // explicit inherited-env overlay (`--env`)
  unsetEnv?: string[];         // inherited env keys removed before `extraEnv`
  env?: { [k: string]: string };      // exact child env for programmatic callers
  createdAt: string;          // ISO 8601
  exitCode?: number;          // present after clean exit
  exitedAt?: string;
  lastLines?: string[];       // snapshotted at exit
  tags?: { [k: string]: string };
  displayName?: string;
  lastAttachAt?: string;      // ISO 8601 — set by the daemon on every non-readonly ATTACH
}
```

`unsetEnv` and `extraEnv` form the persisted inherited-environment policy.
Removals are applied first and explicit assignments second, so an assignment
wins when both mention the same key. Older metadata without `unsetEnv` keeps
the historical ambient-inheritance behavior.

- Status (`running` / `exited` / `vanished`) is *derived*, not stored. A
  reachable socket or live pidfile process proves the daemon is running. If
  both paths are absent,
  `daemonPid` is accepted only when the retained recovery process-start token
  still matches that OS process.
- `generation` and `daemonPid` are internal lifecycle guards. A daemon only
  removes files still owned by its generation, and `pty rm` waits for that
  daemon to finish deferred shutdown before it reports success. Readers should
  treat the generation token as opaque.
- `recovery` is present only when the daemon can prove its OS process-start
  identity and the selected root is owned by the daemon user with no
  group/other permissions. A snapshot containing this capability can authenticate
  `pty recover` after the socket, pid, and metadata paths are externally
  unlinked. The root is mode `0700`; treat the embedded secret as opaque and
  do not publish snapshots. The root and `.recovery` directory identities and
  permissions are revalidated before recovery state is exchanged. A signed
  retained revision rejects older snapshots after tags, display name, attach
  state, or other metadata changes. The signed revision advances before changed
  metadata is renamed into place: a partial publication may disable recovery,
  but never re-authorizes the previous snapshot. Successful recovery rotates
  the secret.
- `displayName` is mutable presentation metadata and is not unique. Stable
  identity remains the `<name>` filename stem; consumers must not use
  `displayName` as a durable key.
- Reserved tag keys (`ptyfile*`, `strategy`, anything starting with `:`) are pty/tool-internal; hidden from `pty list` unless `--tags`.
- User-facing tags that drive pty behavior but are visible by default:
  - `strategy=permanent` — `pty gc` respawns the session when its daemon exits (the historic supervisor's role; now stateless and run on a cron).
  - `strategy.abandon-if-cwd-gone=false` — opts a permanent session OUT of the on-by-default cwd-gone reap in `pty gc` step 1.5. Only meaningful with `strategy=permanent`.
  - `strategy.idle-days=<N>` — opts a permanent session INTO idle-reap: `pty gc` reaps it when `lastAttachAt` is older than N days. Takes precedence over the global `--idle-days` flag.
  - `parent=<name>` — `pty gc` orphan-kills this session (SIGTERM + cleanup) when the referenced session's daemon is no longer alive. Combinator with `strategy=permanent` is well-defined: orphan-kill wins.
  - `keep=true` — exempts the session from reaping, both the daemon's exit-time self-cleanup and `pty gc`'s sweep. Its metadata, `lastLines`, and events file survive its death until an explicit `pty rm`. Any value other than `false`/`0`/`no`/`off` counts as set, so a mis-spelled value errs toward retaining. Without this tag, a non-permanent session's files are gone the moment its command finishes.
- Lifetime: a non-permanent session's files are removed by its own daemon during shutdown once the child process terminates. Files therefore outlive the process only for `keep`, `strategy=permanent`, external `pty kill`, and `vanished` sessions (SIGKILLed daemon — no cleanup code ran). Readers that poll these files after a session finishes must set `keep=true` or accept the race.
- Concurrent writers: last-write-wins; readers never see torn files. Cross-process writers can lose updates to the read-modify-write window.

## `<name>.events.jsonl` (tier 1)

Append-only JSONL, one event per line. Auto-truncates from 1000 → 500 lines via atomic rewrite (the inode changes; tailing readers should re-open).

Envelope: `{ session: string; type: string; ts: string; ...payload }`. Event types (source: `src/events.ts`):

| type | payload |
|---|---|
| `bell` | — |
| `title_change` | `value: string` |
| `notification` | `title?, body?, source?: "osc9" \| "osc99" \| "osc777"` |
| `focus_request` | — |
| `cursor_visible` | — |
| `session_start` | `tags?` |
| `session_exit` | `exitCode, signal?` — signal death (e.g. OOM SIGKILL) surfaces as `exitCode` = 128 + `signal` (SIGKILL 9 → 137), matching shell `$?`; `signal` carries the raw number |
| `session_exec` | `previousCommand, command` |
| `session_respawn` | — (`pty gc` respawned a `strategy=permanent` session) |
| `session_abandoned` | `reason: "cwd-gone" \| "idle", idleDays?` — (`pty gc` reaped a live permanent session detected as abandoned) |
| `session_flapping` | `counter, limit, window` — (`pty gc` flipped a permanent session to `strategy.status=flapping` after N consecutive fast-fail respawns; subsequent ticks skip it) |
| `session_descendants_survived` | `data: { pids }` — a daemon signalled its child's process tree with TERM and then KILL and these processes were still alive. A record of what it could not kill, not a list of everything that outlived the session: a process that left the tree before the snapshot is not in it |
| `display_name_change` | `previous: string\|null, value: string\|null` |
| `tags_change` | `previous, value` (full snapshots) |
| `metadata_change` | `previous, value` containing only changed `displayName` and tag keys; absent tag values are `null` |
| `user.<name>` | `data?, text?` — free-form, via `pty emit` |

All event writers and retention rewrites are serialized by the per-session
event lock. A complete JSONL record is therefore published without relying on
an operating-system write-size limit, and retention cannot discard an append
that races its atomic rewrite. Async writers wait up to five seconds for a live
holder; synchronous writers fail immediately. Lock files are removed on release,
and a dead holder's stale lock is reclaimed by the next writer or cleanup.

## Reading from outside pty

```sh
jq -r '.tags["role"] // empty' "$PTY_ROOT/myserver.json"
```

For live updates, tail `<name>.events.jsonl` via `inotify` / `kqueue`. Subscribe instead of polling — `metadata_change` / `tags_change` / `display_name_change` / `session_*` fire on every mutation.
