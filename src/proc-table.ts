 * truncated, or silent, and each of those looked exactly like "the process is
 * gone".
 *
 * Node cannot make the syscalls the Rust tool uses, so this does what Node can:
 *
 * **On Linux there is no subprocess at all.** `/proc` carries ppid, pgid, state
 * and starttime, which is every fact the callers ask for.
 *
 * **On macOS `ps` stays, but it is read once per operation** rather than once
 * per process per poll. That is the difference between 240 spawns inside a
 * 1500 ms deadline and 60.
 *
 * **And silence is its own answer everywhere.** Every query returns an
 * {@link Answer}, which separates "the table says this process is not there"
 * from "I could not find out". There is deliberately no default and no
 * conversion that lets the second quietly become the first.
